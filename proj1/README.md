# Duque in Java

This Java project implements a deque data structure using both lists and arrays.

## Features

- **Addfirst**
  - Adds an item to the front of the deque.

- **Addlast**
  - Adds an item to the back of the deque.

- **isEmpty**
  - Returns true if deque is empty, false otherwise.

- **size**
  - Returns the number of items in the deque.

- **printDeque**
  - Prints the items in the deque from first to last, separated by a space. Once all the items have been printed, print out a new line.

- **removeFirst**
  - Removes and returns the item at the front of the deque. If no such item exists, returns null.

- **removeLast**
  - Removes and returns the item at the back of the deque. If no such item exists, returns null.

- **get**
  - Gets the item at the given index, where 0 is the front, 1 is the next item, and so forth. If no such item exists, returns null. Must not alter the deque!

- **equals**
  - Returns whether or not the passed deque parameter is equal to the Deque. It is considered equal if it is a Deque and if it contains the same contents.

- **iterator**
  - Iterates over all elements in the deque.
